## K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that's a great starting point for machine learning beginners. In this repository, you'll find examples of k-NN implementation and usage.

## Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm commonly used for text classification and spam filtering. Dive into the examples here to understand its mechanics and see it in action.

## Decision Trees

Decision Trees are versatile tools for classification and regression tasks. Explore our decision tree examples to grasp the concept and learn how to avoid common pitfalls.

## Keras

Keras is a high-level neural networks API that makes it easy to build and experiment with deep learning models. Check out our Keras examples to start building your neural networks.

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are at the heart of modern machine learning, enabling us to tackle complex problems. This repository includes introductory examples to get you started with neural networks.

## Getting Started

Each subdirectory in this repository contains code examples, explanations, and resources related to a specific concept or library. Feel free to navigate to the subdirectories of your interest and explore the content.

To run the code examples, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can usually find these requirements in a dedicated `requirements.txt` file within each subdirectory.
